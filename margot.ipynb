I had a lot of fun with monologue, but now let's get down to brass tacks. Okay? Kangaroos did a donkey rabbit what I wouldn't They have a donkey face, but a rabbit hop. Oh, I see what you're saying. I had no idea where that was going to be really a donkey eyes and I see I don't know. Maybe I hadn't we got a conclusive maybe from the Austria now you are from Australia. If you can't tell from the accent and when you see your work people wouldn't know that because you do such a great American accent, but you are Australian. Where did you grow up on the Gold Coast but I grew up in the hinterland part of the Gold Coast. Okay, the hinterland. Oh, that means like it's like, you know, I grew up in property. Okay fields, and now I know I've been to I don't I don't support like this. Like I hate The Stereotype like everyone thinks. Oh, you're from Australia. They were creepy crawly poisonous venomous things all over the place, but are there creepy crawly poisonous venomous things all over the place. I mean kind of if it's not something you concentrate on when you're growing up. But yeah that mean there's tons of poison. I think there's like a large percentage of the poison. Makes the world reside in Australia and spiders and wow shocks have you so you had there's like sharks and poisonous spiders and snakes a lot of dangerous creatures growing up but it's fine. I mean you don't when you're when you live there you don't you don't worry about it or think about it. I mean they're there but I didn't it didn't really seem like a big deal like of 10 of your closest friends growing up how many of them were killed by poison seven. No. No, I don't mean I don't even know I mean I grew up on property and I don't even know someone who is I had snakes like literally in my house growing up but not on purpose like by, you know, they would get into the house or whatever. What kind of snakes they what would be like the biggest like you want like a like a carpet python if they've got like a gold pattern on their back then Kinder a copper pipe in the end the they're fine. I mean for sometimes if they're little often, they're probably more poisonous. So you kind of like get them out with the stick instead of picking it up, but the stick yeah, like like a stick you can you keep a stick. Stick up like this one time. I was my mom came. I was I was in my bratty teen years and my mom came in said oh this can you help me get the snake out of the house and I was like Mom, I'm really busy on MSN like No And she was like, it's a big one though like an you and I was like so busy mom no, and then she like went away and 10 minutes later. I was like, where's mom and that's when my mom got eaten? No, she didn't. Of giant snake from your mom would I stick this stick method other than like instances like that? I felt no danger at all growing up in Australia. So just completely shifting topics to like a more James lift any kind of question. If you could have lunch with any celebrity, huh living or dead, would you take them to Outback Steakhouse? I've actually never eaten at an Outback Steakhouse. I'm ruining every I shouldn't have said that I should have lied. Let me ask you this. I heard that they do have Outback Steakhouse in Australia. Yeah for sure an ex-boyfriend of mine. There's like a challenge if you eat, I think it's like a kilo of steak and all the like you eat all this stuff you get a free t-shirt. Yeah and a boyfriend of mine way back when tried to do the challenge, but he was literally like vomiting as he was trying to keep eating it to win this t-shirt. He got there in the end. You got this you got the shirt. Yeah dang, but he didn't get Margot Robbie. Did he sorry pal? Speaking of restaurants. Did you ever did you have like a normal upbringing did you ever I work in a restaurant? Did you ever work in a restaurant growing up? I did I did I worked in a restaurant from I think about 10 to 15 guys. So I was working really young. Well, I was you. All right. Well, I started like back in the kitchens. I was like polishing Cutlery and then I upgraded to peeling potatoes and then I was a dish Pig and then I was a waitress and then by about 14 I was behind the bar and that was like the fun part. Whoa 14 behind the bar that legal in Australia. No, it's not. I don't know. Sometimes I had be like giving someone a drink and they'll be like yeah to peers. Are you old enough to give me there and I was like you want to be or not know like well, yeah so that I got away with it. That's nice. No, it's not legal. It's not is that legal do you have what's in a rum and coke? It's a tough one a lot of ramen little bit of coke. Are you more of like a beer person or like whiskey person? Beer definitely a Beer Drinker. Can I get some beer anyone Guillermo? Can you bring us a couple beers? Yeah. Sure. It does tonight outside grip when I come back. You're going to see the lovely Margot Robbie and I have a beer so don't go anywhere .8 I get a fair shot here because I'm up at 5:00 every morning working my ass off to someone want to just tell me to my face you're never going to give me the scores I deserve this is how it's done. Some of these girls have paid their dues. Give it a out skated him today. We also judged on presentation. Well, you know what if you can come up with $5,000 for a costume for me, then I won't have to make one till then just stay out of my face. Maybe you're just not as good as you think. Maybe you should pick another sport. Suck my dick now. I don't want you to spoil the movie. Does she end up sucking your yeah, that's how it is. Actually one of the rare things that Tanya actually didn't say but when she saw the movie the real Tonya Harding, I mean she was like, I love that line. I wish I had actually said Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I can actually have a party trick I can open this. I can only are finding with already on Earth and beers though, so I can't open. Yeah mode you yeah. Sure. I help you prepare. This is amazing. Hey, cheers. She's the I Tanya. So I'm curious about this because you made a movie about a real person an Infamous figure skater. I mean, she's Tonya Harding everybody. What's that? Like is she part of the process is does she is she there on said did you meet her? How did that work? I met her. She wasn't a consultant on set. She wasn't she already did a series of interviews with her and and then he did a series of interviews with Jeff gillooly and both their stories contradict to contradicted each other so much that he thought that was the best way to tell the story to have all these unreliable narrators, you know, with contradicting storylines and kind of let the audience decide for themselves how it happened. So I flew to meet her right before we started shooting and other than that she wasn't on set or anything but we showed her the movie right before we premiered at torrent. Oh, so yeah, do you think she's watching this right now? I don't know. I didn't think about that if you are. Hi Tanya, what's up, Tonya Harding? What's up Tonya? I like the movie. I thought it was really Right and I think and I think you nailed the character of Tonya Harding that's got to be an interesting and difficult thing to do meeting somebody but then telling a story when there's so many conflicting perspectives on how the story went down. Now your didn't know the skating is off the chain. Like did you how long did you train to with with the skating? It did a lot of training I did I did maybe whole months of training for five months. It was like five days a week three four hours a day. It was the what compared to what an olympic-level I've skated with Tonya Harding I didn't but when I did meet her she was she was so lovely when I met her she was more worried about me than I was about her and she was like, how you going with the skating and I said, well, it's I mean, it's really really hard actually and she's like, do you need any tip like, do you want me to help we can go to the ice skating rink now like to have your skates with you and I was like, well, they didn't let me bring them on the plane. So no bright but it should have told her that you should have said that they were Support skates I should have any good brought on by Tanya is in theaters, Friday Margot Robbie everyone.
